/**
 * Known WCAG 1.4.11 / generated-content findings in this lab, captured through
 * the gate's own path so the baseline and the check cannot disagree.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS A TO-DO LIST, NOT A SET OF EXEMPTIONS. The gate ratchets on it:
 *   - a finding NOT listed here fails the run, so a regression cannot land;
 *   - a listed finding whose ratio gets WORSE fails, so the list cannot rot;
 *   - a listed finding that no longer appears ALSO fails, so a fixed entry must
 *     be deleted and the file can only shrink toward empty.
 * The last rule is what stops an allowlist becoming a permanent exemption.
 *
 * `unverified: true` marks an absolutely-positioned pseudo-element. It can paint
 * outside its host and the oracle measures it against the host's backdrop, so
 * that ratio is NOT trustworthy — hand-measure before acting on it.
 *
 * Every finding inside `#app` — this lab's own markup — passes outright: nothing
 * in this lab was ever added here. The two entries below are the whole file. Both are in the SHARED CRYPTO LAB
 * TOP BAR, the block of markup and CSS that every repo in this fleet carries a
 * byte-identical copy of. `.cl-btn` draws its edge as
 * `color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 38%, transparent)` over the bar's fixed
 * `#0b1512`, and with this lab's `--accent` (#00d4ff, a bright cyan) that
 * resolves to an edge measuring 2.50:1 against that background — the highest
 * value this defect takes anywhere in the sweep so far, and still short of 3:1. It is
 * reported upward as a fleet-wide observation rather than patched in one repo,
 * because a one-repo edit to the shared header is exactly the drift this fleet's
 * conventions forbid; when the shared block is fixed, these two entries stop
 * appearing and the ratchet will fail until they are deleted, which is the
 * intended way to find out.
 *
 * The number is `--accent`-sensitive, which is the whole reason it is written
 * down: the SAME shared block measures 1.83:1 in a lab whose accent is a warm
 * orange and 1.29:1 in one whose accent is a dark red. Whoever fixes the shared
 * header has to fix it for the darkest accent in the fleet, not for this one.
